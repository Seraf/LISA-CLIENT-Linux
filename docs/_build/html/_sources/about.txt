This is the Linux Client.
Actually, there is no speech recording input as it isn't stable enough to have something production ready.
This client will connect to LISA and will vocalize sentence received.

A good use case is to let your home automation box use the LISA Server API to vocalize a string somewhere in your house.

In the future, this client will use different engines (pocketsphinx, google speech) to record sentences, and with a keyword spotting.
Keep in touch !
